## Problem Statement

The PhonePe Pulse GitHub repository houses a vast amount of data related to various metrics and statistics. The objective is to extract, process, and visualize this data in a user-friendly manner. The solution must encompass the following steps:

1. **Data Extraction:** Clone the PhonePe Pulse GitHub repository using scripting to fetch and store the data in a suitable format like CSV or JSON.

2. **Data Transformation:** Utilize Python, Pandas, and other relevant libraries to manipulate and pre-process the data. This involves cleaning, handling missing values, and transforming the data into a format suitable for analysis and visualization.

3. **Database Insertion:** Connect to a MySQL database using the "mysql-connector-python" library and insert the transformed data using SQL commands for efficient storage and retrieval.

4. **Dashboard Creation:** Leverage Streamlit and Plotly libraries to create an interactive and visually appealing dashboard. Utilize Plotly's geo map functions to display data on a map and Streamlit to create a user-friendly interface with multiple dropdown options for users to select different facts and figures.

5. **Data Retrieval:** Connect to the MySQL database using "mysql-connector-python" to fetch data into a Pandas dataframe. Dynamically update the dashboard with the latest data.

6. **Deployment:** Ensure the solution is secure, efficient, and user-friendly. Thoroughly test the solution and deploy the dashboard publicly, making it accessible to users.
